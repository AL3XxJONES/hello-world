# hello-world
New to all of this, looking for people to brainstorm and work with.
Can read and write (fumble) my way through HTML.  Not a fan of CSS.  However, I have fallen in love with JS.  I am an entrepreneur.  Owned a few businesses that I recently sold.  I started learning to write code just for something to do and now I am addicted.  I can't imaging doing anything else for the rest of my life.  I want to do security, social engineering and write my own programs.  I love solving problems and making things more efficient.
